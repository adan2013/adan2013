# Hello there 👋

I'm a Senior Frontend Developer specializing in the React ecosystem, with over 5 years of commercial experience using the library to create advanced user interfaces and views.

My passion for technology extends beyond my professional work. I run a mini tech blog where I share my knowledge. My interest in DIY projects, electronics, and 3D printing has taught me to embrace challenges, explore new fields, and has honed my analytical thinking skills.
